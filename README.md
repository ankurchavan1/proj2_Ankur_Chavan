ENPM661 Project 2: Implementation of Dijkstra Algorith

The code takes the start node and goal node positions as input from the user.
In order to see the implementation input the x and y coordinates of the start node and goal node.
The code will give the visual representation of all the node exploration while avoiding the obstacles and shows the shortest path in the end.

Libraries used:

pygame
math
sys
numpy

Note:
While calculting the obstacle space, I have hard coded the clearance while defining the obstacle space itself.
To make it more modular the ideal way must be to take clearance as variable and incorporate it in the half equations.
